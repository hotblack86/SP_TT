The test is as follows:


1. Write a program that:

a. Receives a log file as an argument (webserver.log is provided) e.g.: ./<parse> webserver.log

b. Returns the following:
> list of webpages with most page views ordered from most pages views to less page views e.g.:
/home 90 visits /index 80 visits etc...
> list of webpages with most unique page views also ordered e.g.:
/about/2 8 unique views /index 5 unique views etc...



Finally, have some fun â€“ Feel free to make changes or design something if you think it meets the criteria above, but would produce better outcomes and of course, the sooner you return the test, the quicker we can move the process.
